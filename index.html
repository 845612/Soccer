<img id="image1" src="soccerball.jpg">
<P>The soccer team Habibi FC was first created about a year and a half ago. That's when this group of friends first started playing together at the Denver Sports Center. They have been playing together for multiple seasons about 9 or 10. Everytime a season ends they sign up for a new season because they enjoy playing the sport and together.</p>
<p>Although they barely started playing as Habibi FC about a year and a half ago they have each been playing soccer for much longer. The least amount any of the team mebers has been playing is 5 years. This meaning that all the players players have been playing for over 5 years. Some of them playing since they were in middle school or younger.</p>
<p>Alot of the team members met in high school. They played at Abraham Lincoln High School on the socceer team. They realized that they played well together and decided to continue playing together. That is why after high school, they made an indoor soccer team together.</p>
<p>Although some of the members met and started playing in high school, others played together in middle school. They met and started playing in middle school. They then continued onto high school together and played on the same team. Some of them lettered for playing soccer.</p>
<p>The captain's passion is soccer. He has been playing soccer since he was very young. He played soccer at Abraham Lincoln High School. Not only did he play on the boys soccer team but he managed the girls soccer team.</p>
<p>Since they have been playing together they have won multiple tournaments. They have won about 5 tournaments, give or take. Recently they just finished a season. They won the tournament undefeated.</p>
<p>Since this season is now over they still plan on signing up for the next season. As of now it does not seem like they think of quitting any time soon. It seems that as long as they are friends and can keep playing, they will. The team has gone through many people.</p>
<p>Some of the poayers have experienced injuries. One of the players hurt her ankle. Another player hurt her knee. That does not stop them from playing. As soon as they are well enough to play, they get back out on thw field.</p>
